Why rewrite the whell for smoke tests or leave stuff untested?

Automates a setup and call for Smoke Test by checking a chain of calls and replying with info about how the test ran.

Has config and API to build up monitoring pages.

NancyFx for API
RestSharp for calls
NUnit and RhinoMocks for testing
NuGet to put it together
